# Recommendation_System_SC348810

Recommendation AI-enabled system for local store.
The application is an AI-driven recommendation system specifically designed
for local convenience stores. Its primary function is to analyze historical purchase data
to identify patterns and associations between products that customers frequently buy
together. Leveraging this data, the system generates real-time recommendations for
store employees and managers to optimize shelf arrangements, ensuring related items
are placed in proximity for easier to get them together. Additionally, it assists cashiers
in suggesting complementary products to customers at the point of sale. This system
aims to enhance the customer shopping experience and has the potential to increase
overall sales by promoting additional items that customers may not have initially
considered.
